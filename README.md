# Logistic-Regression-in-Machine-Learning

Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, which comes under the **Supervised Learning technique**. It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.

Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable. Therefore the outcome must be a categorical or discrete value. It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc. but instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, **it gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1.**

Logistic Regression is much similar to the Linear Regression except that how they are used. **Linear Regression is used for solving Regression problems**, whereas **Logistic regression is used for solving the classification problems.**



## Type of Logistic Regression:
On the basis of the categories, Logistic Regression can be classified into three types:

- **Binomial:** In binomial Logistic regression, there can be only two possible types of the dependent variables, such as 0 or 1, Pass or Fail, etc.
- **Multinomial:** In multinomial Logistic regression, there can be 3 or more possible unordered types of the dependent variable, such as "cat", "dogs", or "sheep"
- **Ordinal:** In ordinal Logistic regression, there can be 3 or more possible ordered types of dependent variables, such as "low", "Medium", or "High".


## Steps to implement Logistic Regression:
- Data Pre-processing step
- Fitting Logistic Regression to the Training set
- Predicting the test result
- Test accuracy of the result(Creation of Confusion matrix)
- Visualizing the test set result.
